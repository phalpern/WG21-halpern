Abstract
========

The `pmr::resource_adaptor` class template in the Library Fundamentals TS wraps
an object whose type that meets the allocator requirements and gives it a
`pmr::memory_resource` interface.  When the polymorphic allocator
infrastructure was moved from the Library Fundamentals TS to the C++17 working
draft, `pmr::resource_adaptor` was left behind. The decision not to move
`pmr::resource_adaptor` was deliberately conservative, but the absence of
`resource_adaptor` in the standard is a hole that must be plugged for a smooth
use of `pmr` allocators as a simplified, non-template, allocator model that is
fully compatible with the general C++ template-argument allocator model.  This
paper proposes that `pmr::resource_adaptor` be moved from the LFTS, slightly
modified, and added to the C++26 working draft.

Status
======

On Oct 5, 2021, a subgroup of LWG reviewed P1083R3 and found an issue in the
way the max alignment supported by `pmr::resource_adaptor` was specified in the
paper. There was general consensus that a `MaxAlign` template parameter
would be preferable, but the change was considered to be of a design nature and
therefore requires LEWG review.  The R4 revision of this paper contains
the changes from LEWG review and the R5 revision contains fixes identified in
the LWG reflector discussion that followed.

On March 15, 2022 LEWG reviewed [@P1083R5] in a telcon.  Because of scheduling
and technical concerns, it was decided that the paper was not ready for C++23
but that the paper should be revised and brought back to LEWG with the intent
of forwarding for C++26. The R6 revision contains the fixes required by LEWG
and the R7 revision added a missing `noexcept` and improved the LWG wording in
one small section.

This version brings the paper up to date with the latest WP and should be ready
for final LEWG review and (re)forwarding to LWG.

Change History
==============

Changes from R7 to R8 (pre St. Louis 2024)
------------------------------------------

* Re-based to April 2024 WP [@N4981] and updated status.
* Added variadic constructor to *resource-adaptor-imp*.

Changes from R6 to R7 (pre Kona 2022)
-------------------------------------

* Reworded additional requirements on the `Allocator` parameter to follow the
  proper voice of the standard (thanks to Daniel Kruegler).
* Added `noexcept` to `get_adapted_allocator`.

Changes from R5 to R6 (from LEWG telcon)
----------------------------------------

* Defined `max_align_v` as `inline constexpr`.
* Removed nested `type` from `aligned_raw_storage`. Made it clear that
  `aligned_raw_storage` is not a drop-in replacement for `aligned_storage`.
* Removed `aligned_object_storage`, which was not needed for this proposal,
  from the formal wording. This facility might come back in a separate paper.
* Changed ship vehicle to C++26.

Changes from R4 to R5 (from LWG reflector discussion)
-----------------------------------------------------

* Mandate that `T` for `aligned_object_storage<T>` must be an object type.
* Clarify that `T` for `aligned_object_storage<T>` may be cv-qualified.
* Change LFTS reference from v2 to v3.

Changes from R3 to R4 (from LWG telcon)
----------------------------------------------

* Added _[Design changes](#design-changes-for-lewg-review)_ section that
  describes changes after LWG review.
* Added `MaxType` as a second template parameter to `pmr::resource_adaptor`.
* Added the `max_align_v` constant, `aligned_type` metafunction,
  `aligned_raw_storage` class template, and `aligned_object_storage` class
  template.
* Made a few editorial changes to comply with LWG style.

Changes from R2 to R3 (in Kona and pre-Cologne)
-----------------------------------------------

* Changed __`resource-adaptor-imp`__ to kabob case.
* Removed special member functions (copy/move ctors, etc.) and let them be
  auto-generated.
* Added a requirement that the `Allocator` template parameter must support
  rebinding to any non-class, non-over-aligned type. This allows the
  implementation of `do_allocate` to dispatch to a suitably rebound copy of
  the allocator as needed to support any native alignment argument.

Changes from R1 to R2 (in San Diego)
------------------------------------

* Paper was forwarded from LEWG to LWG on Tuesday, 2018-10-06
* Copied the formal wording from the LFTS directly into this paper
* Minor wording changes as per initial LWG review
* Rebased to the October 2018 draft of the C++ WP

Changes from R0 to R1 (pre-San Diego)
-------------------------------------

* Added a note for LWG to consider clarifying the alignment requirements for
  `resource_adaptor<A>::do_allocate()`.
* Changed rebind type from `char` to `byte`.
* Rebased to July 2018 draft of the C++ WP.

Motivation
==========

It is expected that more and more classes, especially those that would not
otherwise be templates, will use `pmr::polymorphic_allocator<byte>` to allocate
memory rather than specifying an allocator as a template parameter. In order to
pass an allocator to one of these classes, the allocator must either already be
a polymorphic allocator, or must be adapted from a non-polymorphic allocator.
The process of adaptation is facilitated by `pmr::resource_adaptor`, which is a
simple class template, has been in the LFTS for a long time, and has been fully
implemented. It is therefore a low-risk, high-benefit component to add to the
C++ WP.

Summary of Proposal
===================

The central new class template in this proposal is
`std::pmr::resource_adaptor`, which wraps a class meeting the *Cpp17Allocator*
requirements with a class derived from `std::pmr::memory_resource`.  Consider
an allocator-aware class `Employee` that is not a template and therefore has no
`Allocator` template parameter. Instead an `Employee` uses
`std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator` using the standard idiom:

```cpp
class Employee
{
  std::pmr::string m_name;
  unsigned         m_id;

public:
  using allocator_type = std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>;

  Employee(std::string_view name, unsigned id, const allocator_type& alloc = {})
    : m_name(name, alloc), m_id(id) { }

  // ..

  allocator_type get_allocator() const { return m_name.get_allocator(); }
};
```

There also exists a useful allocator, `MyAlloc`, that conforms to the allocator
requirements:

```cpp
template <class T>
class MyAlloc
{
public:
  using value_type = T;
  MyAlloc(void* baseptr);  // arbitrary ctor parameter for illustration
  T* allocate(std::size_t n);
  void deallocate(T* p, std::size_t n);
  // ...
};
```

One can pass a `MyAlloc` object as an allocator to `Employee` by wrapping it
in `resource_adaptor`:

```cpp
using MyAllocRsrc = std::pmr::resource_adaptor<MyAlloc<char>>;
MyAllocRsrc theRsrc(getBasePtr());     // Ctor argument for wrapped allocator
Employee e("Superman", 99, &theRsrc);  // Pass allocator to `Employee`
```

In addition to `pmr::resource_adaptor`, this paper proposes:

* `max_align_v`: an alias for `alignof(max_align_t)`
* `aligned_raw_storage<Align, Size>`: a buffer of bytes having the specified
  alignment and minimum size
* `aligned_type<Align>`: a metafunction returning a type with the specified
  alignment

These additions are needed to cleanly specify `pmr::resource_adaptor`, but are
also useful in their own right.


Design changes R6 to current (for LEWG review)
==============================================

The following design changes were made as a consequence of discussions in LWG
on 5 October 2021.  LWG felt that the scope of these changes warranted review
by LEWG.

**`MaxAlign` template argument**:
A `pmr::resource_adaptor` instance wraps an object having a type that meets the
Allocator requirements. Its `do_allocate` virtual member function supplies
aligned memory by invoking the `allocate` member function on the wrapped
allocator. The only way to supply alignment information to the wrapped
allocator is to rebind it for a `value_type` having the desired alignment but,
because the alignment is specified to `pmr::resource_adaptor::allocate` at run
time, the implementation must rebind its allocator for every possible alignment
and dynamically choose the correct one. In order to keep the number of such
rebound instantiations manageable and reduce the requirements on the allocator
type, an upper limit (default `alignof(max_align_t)`) can be specified when
instantiating `pmr::resource_adaptor`. This recent change was made after
discussion with members of LWG, and with their encouragement.

**(Optional) `constexpr` value `max_align_v`**:
The standard has a type, `std::max_align_t`, whose alignment is at least as
great as that of every scalar type. I found that I was continually referring to
the *value*, `alignof(std::max_align_t)`. In fact, *every single use* of
`max_align_t` in the standard is as the operand of `alignof`. As a drive-by
fix, therefore, this proposal introduces the constant `max_align_v` as a more
straightforward spelling of `alignof(max_align_t)`.  Note that the introduction
of this constant is completely severable from the proposal if it is deemed
undesirable. The name is also subject to bikeshedding (e.g., by removing the
`_v`).

**Alias template `std::aligned_type`**:
This alias is effectively a metafunction that resolves to a scalar type if
possible, otherwise to a specialization of `aligned_raw_storage`. Its use in
this specification allows `pmr::resource_adaptor` to work with minimalist
allocators, including those that can be rebound only for scalar types.  For
over-aligned values, it uses `aligned_raw_storage`, below. Both
`aligned_raw_storage` and `aligned_type` are declared in header `<memory>`, but
LEWG could consider putting them somewhere else (e.g., in `<utility>`).

**Class template `std::aligned_raw_storage`**:
When instantiated with an alignment greater than `max_align_v`,
`std::aligned_type` could be defined vaguely in terms of an unspecified
over-aligned type, but LWG wanted to be more precise so as to better describe
the allowable set of allocators usable with `resource_adaptor`. The obvious
choice of the over-aligned type would have been `std::aligned_storage`, but
that template has been deprecated as a result of numerous flaws described in
[@P1413R3].  The class template `std::aligned_raw_storage` is
intended to replace `std::aligned_storage` and correct the problems associated
with it; specifically, it is not a metafunction, but a `struct` template, and
it provides direct access to its data buffer, which can be validly cast to a
pointer to any type having the specified alignment (or less). The relationship
between size and alignment is specifically described in the wording, so
programmers can rely on it. Note that `aligned_raw_storage` is not a drop-in
replacement for the deprecated `aligned_storage` metafunction because the
arguments are reversed and it does not provide a `type` member typedef.

**(Not proposed) Class template `std::aligned_object_storage`**:
The alignment parameter for `aligned_raw_storage`, described above, is
specified as a number rather than as a type -- as needed for low-level types
like `pmr::resource_adaptor` -- and the storage must be cast to the desired
type before it's used. This primitive type practically screams for the
introduction of an aligned storage type parameterized on the type of object you
wish to store in it.  Although not needed for this proposal, prior revisions of
this proposal included `aligned_object_storage` for this purpose. However,
because of technical concerns regarding the design of `aligned_object_storage`,
it was decided that it would be best to split it out into its own paper so
that it could be refined (or rejected) separately, without affecting this
proposal.


Impact on the standard
======================

`pmr::resource_adaptor` is a pure library extension requiring no changes to the
core language nor to any existing classes in the standard library. A couple of
general-purpose templates (`aligned_type` and `aligned_raw_storage`) are also
added as pure library extensions.

Implementation Experience
=========================

A full implementation of the current proposal can be found in GitHub at
[https://github.com/phalpern/WG21-halpern/tree/P1083/P1083-resource_adaptor](https://github.com/phalpern/WG21-halpern/tree/P1083/P1083-resource_adaptor).

The version described in the Library Fundamentals TS has been implemented by
multiple vendors in the `std::experimental::pmr` namespace.


Formal Wording
==============

_This proposal is based on the Library Fundamentals TS v3 [@N4873] and the
April 2024 draft of the C++ WP [@N4981]_.

In [cstddef.syn]{.sref}, add the following definition
sometime after the declaration of `max_align_t` in header `<cstddef>`:

::: add
>| `inline constexpr size_t max_align_v = alignof(max_align_t);`
:::

In section [memory.syn]{.sref}, add the following declarations to `<memory>`
(probably near the top, between *pointer alignment* and *explicit lifetime
management*):

::: add
>| `template <size_t Align, size_t Sz = Align> struct aligned_raw_storage;`
>| `template <size_t Align> using aligned_type =` *see below*`;`
:::

Insert within [ptr.align]{.sref} and [obj.lifetime]{.sref} the description of
these new templates:

::: add

> **20.2.? Aligned storage [aligned.storage]**

> **20.2.?.1 Aligned raw storage [aligned.raw.storage]**

> An instantiation of template `aligned_raw_storage` is a standard-layout
> trivial type that provides storage having the specified alignment and size,
> where the size is rounded up to the nearest multiple of the alignment.  The
> program is ill-formed unless `Align` is a power of 2.

> ```cpp
> namespace std {
>   template <size_t Align, size_t Sz = Align>
>   struct aligned_raw_storage
>   {
>     static constexpr size_t alignment = Align;
>     static constexpr size_t size      = (Sz + Align - 1) & ~(Align - 1);
>
>     constexpr       void* data()       noexcept { return buffer; }
>     constexpr const void* data() const noexcept { return buffer; }
>
>     alignas(alignment) byte buffer[size];
>   };
> }
> ```

> **20.2.?.3 Aligned type [aligned.type]**

> Instantiating `aligned_type<Align>` yields a type `T`, such that
> `alignof(T) == Align` and `sizeof(T) == Align` If there exists a scalar type,
> meeting these requirements, then `aligned_type<Align>` is an alias for that
> scalar type; otherwise, it is an alias for `aligned_raw_storage<Align,
> Align>`. If more than one scalar meets the requirements for `T`, the one
> chosen is implementation defined, but consistent for all instantiations of
> `aligned_type` with that alignment.  The program is ill-formed unless `Align`
> is a power of 2.

>| `template <size_t Align> using aligned_type =` _see below_;

:::

In [mem.res.syn]{.sref}, add the following declaration
immediately after the declaration of
`operator!=(const polymorphic_allocator...)`:

::: add

> ```cpp
> // 20.4.? resource adaptor for a given alignment.
> // The name @*resource-adaptor-imp*@ is for exposition only.
> template <class Allocator, size_t MaxAlign> class @*resource-adaptor-imp*@;
>
> template <class Allocator, size_t MaxAlign = max_align_v>
>  using resource_adaptor = @*resource-adaptor-imp*@<
>     typename allocator_traits<Allocator>::template rebind_alloc<byte>,
>     MaxAlign>;
> ```

:::

Before section [mem.res.pool]{.sref}, insert the following
section, taken with modifications from section 5.5 of the LFTS v3:

::: add

> **20.4.? Alias template resource_adaptor [memory.resource.adaptor]**

> **20.4.?.1 `resource_adaptor` [memory.resource.adaptor.overview]**
