Abstract
========

The most convenient way to look up an element of a `map`-like container is to
use the index operator, i.e., `theMap[key]`. This operator cannot be used,
however, when 1) the container is `const`, 2) the mapped type is not default
constructible, 3) the default-constructed value is inappropriate for the
context, or 4) the container should not be modified. These limitations often
force the user to resort to the `find` member function, which returns an
iterator that points to a `pair` and typically leads to more complex code
having at least one `if` statement and/or duplicate lookup operations. Taking
inspiration from other languages, especially Python, this paper proposes the
addition (in C++29) of a `get` member function that returns `optional<T&>` and
leverages the observers and monadic operations of `optional`, such as
`value_or`, to simplify lookups for `map`, `unordered_map`, and
`flat_map`. This proposal's usefulness would also be enhanced by the
`maybe` facilities proposed in [@P1255].

Change Log
==========

**R5** (2025-10 pre-Kona mailing)

- Rebased to [@N5014]
- Updated abstract to reflect the fact that P2988 was merged into the WP.
- Added editorial comments encouraging moving descriptions into associative
  container requirements sections.
- Added complexity clause for `unordered_map::get`.

**R4** (2025-06-20 in Sofia)

- Rebased to [@N5008]
- Added `constexpr`.
- Added `flat_map` support.
- Fixed typo in feature-test macro.
- Recorded the vote in LEWG to keep the name `.get` and not change it to
  `.lookup`.
- This revision (R4) was forwarded from LEWG to LWG.

**R3** (2024-10-15 pre-Wroclaw mailing)

- Removed wording that duplicates parts of [@P2988R7].
- Removed enhancements to `optional<T>::value_or` that will be handled in a
  separate paper, [@P1255], by Steve Downey.

**R2** (2024-05-23 pre-St. Louis mailing)

- LEWG Reached consensus on some aspects of [@P2988R4] - specifically that
  `value_or` should return an rvalue for both `optional<T>` and
  `optional<T&>`.  This change is reflected in the wording for this paper.
  Rather than a separate `optional<T>::or_construct` member, the functionality
  of `or_construct` is folded into an enhanced `value_or` both `optional<T>`
  and `optional<T&>`.

**R1** (post 2024-02-27 LEWGI teleconference)

- As a result of discussions in LEWGI on 27 Feb 2024, the return value of `get`
  was changed from `mapped_type` to `optional<mapped_type&>`, and the
  functionality of `get_ref` and `get_as` were delegated to `optional`. Note
  that `optional<T&>` is not valid in C++23 but is proposed in [@P2988R4] for
  C++26.
- Added a proposed `or_construct` member to `optional`
- Proposed an enhancement of `optional<T&>::value_or` over that in [@P2988R4]
- Added feature-test macros

**R0** (2024-02-15 pre-Tokyo mailing)

- Initial version

Motivation
==========

Just about every modern computer language has, as part of the language or its
standard library, one or more associative containers that uniquely map a key to
a value, variously called `map`, `hash_map`, `dictionary`, or something
similar. In C++26, we have `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`, and
`std::flat_map`. The easy-to-write and easy-to-read
expression for getting a value for an associated key is simply `theMap[key]`;
in other words, a mapped value is retrieved (and often set) using the index
operator, which returns a reference to the value associated with the
key. Unfortunately, the index operator in the C++ associative containers has a
number of shortcomings compared to many other languages.

* It works only for non-`const` containers.
* It works only for default-constructible mapped types.
* The default-constructed object (when available) is not always the correct
  identity for a given use case.
* It modifies the container when the key is absent.

Consider a `std::unordered_map` named `theMap` that maps an integer key to a
floating-point value, modeling a sparse array of `double`. If we want to find
the largest of the `double` values mapped to the integer keys in the range 1 to
100, we might be tempted to write the following loop:

```cpp
double largest = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
  largest = std::max(largest, theMap[i]);
```

If `theMap` is `const`, the loop will not compile. If any of the keys in the
range `[1, 100]` are absent from the map, then `theMap[i]` will return a
default-constructed `double` having value 0.0, which might or might not be
desirable, depending on whether we want to treat missing values as truly having
value 0.0 or to ignore them (or, equivalently, to treat them as having value
$-\infty$).  Finally if, before executing this loop, `theMap` contains only,
say, five entries, then at the end of the loop, it will contain at least 100
entries, most of whose values will be zero.

There are alternatives that avoid all these shortcomings but are significantly
less
elegant and therefore more error prone.  For example, the `at` member function
looks a lot like `operator[]` and has none of the above shortcomings, but
missing keys are handled by throwing exceptions, making this option impractical
for situations other than when the key is almost certain to exist. Moreover, a
`try`-`catch` block within a loop is rarely a clean way to structure code:

```cpp
double largest = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
{
  try {
    largest = std::max(largest, theMap.at(i));
  } catch (const std::out_of_range&) { }
}
```

The above code would work with a `const` map, would ignore missing elements
(rather than treating them as zeros), and would not populate the map with
useless entries, but many programmers would argue that the loop is inelegant at
best. In most C++ implementations, this code would be extremely inefficient
unless key misses are rare.

The other obvious alternative uses the `find` member function:

```cpp
double largest = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
{
  auto iter = theMap.find(i);
  if (iter != theMap.end())
    largest = std::max(largest, iter->second);
}
```

This version of the loop is only slightly more verbose than our starting point
and avoids all the issues, but using iterators, needing to call *two* member
functions (`find` and `end`), and having to extract the `second` member of the
element `pair` for what should be a *simple* operation increases the cognitive
load on both the programmer and the reader. Moreover, a generic use of `find`
can yield a subtle bug.  Consider the following function template, `f`:

```cpp
template <class Key, class Value>
void f(const Key& k, const std::map<Key, Value>& aMap)
{
  Value obj = @_some-default-obj-value-expression_@;
  auto iter = aMap.find(k);
  if (iter != aMap.end())
    obj = iter->second;
  // code that uses `obj` ...
}
```

An instantiation of `f` will not compile unless `Value` is copy assignable.
Worse, unless tested with a nonassignable type, the bug could go undetected for
a long time. One fix would be initialize `obj` in a single expression:

```cpp
Value obj = aMap.count(k) ? aMap.at(k) : @_some-default-obj-value-expression_@;
```

While correct, this solution involves two lookup operations: one for the
`count` and one for the `at`.  A better fix requires a bit more code:

```cpp
auto iter = aMap.find(k);
Value obj = iter != aMap.end() ? iter->second : @_some-default-obj-value-expression_@;
```

Note that the last solution again involves `iterator`, `pair`, and a
conditional expression, which is a far cry from the simplicity of `operator[]`.

Let's contrast these less-than-ideal map lookups to dictionary lookups in
another language and consider one way to write the largest-value computation in
Python:

```python
inf = float("inf")
largest = -inf
for i in range(1, 101):
    largest = max(largest, theMap.get(i, -inf))
```

The `get` member of Python's dictionary type looks up the supplied key (first
argument). If the key exists in the dictionary, `get` returns the corresponding
value; otherwise, `get` returns the specified alternative value (second
argument).

In this paper, I propose `get` member functions for `std::map`,
`std::unordered_map`, and `std::flat_map` similar to the `get` member in Python
dictionaries. Because C++ does not have a `None` value like Python's, `get`
returns an `optional`, instead, and delegates the construction of an
alternative return value to the `optional` observer members.

Proposed Feature
================

Overview
--------

What's desired is a simple expression that, given a key, returns the mapped
value if the key exists in a specific map and a user-supplied *alternative
value* if the key does not exist. The proposed feature is a `get` member
function for `map`-like containers that returns `optional<T&>` (or, for a
`const` map, `optional<const T&>`):

```cpp
template<class Key, class T, class Compare = less<Key>,
         class Allocator = allocator<pair<const Key, T>>>
class map {
  // ...
  constexpr optional<      mapped_type&> get(const key_type& k);
  constexpr optional<const mapped_type&> get(const key_type& k) const;
  //...
};
```

These functions depend on having an `optional` template that can be
instantiated with reference types, as proposed in [@P2988R12], which was voted
into the working draft at the June 2025 meeting in Sofia.

Using this feature, the earlier example could be written almost as simply as
the Python version:

```cpp
constexpr double inf = std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
double largest = -inf;
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
  largest = std::max(largest, theMap.get(i).value_or(-inf));
```

Not Proposed: Enhancements to `optional::value_or`
--------------------------------------------------

To maximize the usefulness and convenience of the proposed `get` function,
earlier revisions of this paper also proposed enhancements to
`optional<T>::value_or` and `optional<T&>::value_or`, allowing (but not
requiring) the caller to specify a return type other than `T`, and giving it a
variadic argument list comprising constructor arguments for the return value.
Although such an extension would be useful, it can also be provided through a
non-member function that is expected to be in the next revision of [@P1255]
by Steve Downey. Since that change does not directly relate to the subject of
this proposal, there is no reason to combine it with this paper.  You can see
the proposed extensions in a previous revision of this paper, [@P3091R2].


Before and After Comparisons
============================

The following table shows how operations are simplified using the proposed new
member functions. In these examples, `K`, `T`, and `U` are object types; `m` is
an object of (possibly `const`) `std::map<K, T>`, `unordered_map<K, T>`, or
`flat_map<K, T>`; `k` is a value compatible with `K`; `v` is an lvalue of type
(possibly `const`) `T`; and `a1..aN` are arguments that can used to construct
an object of type `T`.

Alternatives Considered
=======================

Other Names for `get`
---------------------

The name `map::get` is borrowed from the Python dictionary member of the same
name.  Other names considered were `get_optional`, `lookup`, and
`lookup_optional`. The `get` name was selected for brevity and familiarity,
but `lookup` is also concise and is a reasonable alternative.

In Sofia on 2025-06-19, there was weak consensus in LEWG against changing
`get` to `lookup`:

> POLL: Rename `.get` to `.lookup`

| SF | F | N | A | SA |
|----|---|---|---|----|
|  1 | 3 | 6 | 2 | 6  |

However, the author of this paper has authored [@P3857R0] to revisit this
decision, as the currently proposed name would be inconsistent with the
expectation set by the vast majority of `get` functions in the Standard
Library.

Build Get-Value-or-Return-Alternative Functionality Directly into `map`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version R0 of this paper proposed `get`, and `get_ref` member
functions that would look up a key and return the corresponding value (or a
reference to the corresponding value) or else construct an alternative from the
nonkey arguments without, involving `optional<T&>`:

```cpp
// return a value
template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>
  U get(const key_type& key, Args&&... args);
template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>
  U get(const key_type& key, Args&&... args) const;

// return a reference
template <class Arg>
  auto get_ref(const key_type& key, Arg&& ref)       -> common_reference_t<      mapped_type&, Arg>;
template <class Arg>
  auto get_ref(const key_type& key, Arg&& ref) const -> common_reference_t<const mapped_type&, Arg>;
```

The following table shows the usage of the R0 design compared to the
currently proposed design.

### R0 Design (`get` Returns `T`)

**Advantages of the R0 Design Over the Current Design**

- R0 provides more concise and readable calls to `get` (and `get_ref`) in many
  cases.
- The desired return-value-if-present-else-return-alternative functionality is
  all specified in one place in the R0 design, exactly where a beginner would
  look for it.

**Advantages of the Current Design Over the R0 Design**

- The current `get` provides a direct indication, via a disengaged `optional`
  return value, that the key was not found.
- By returning `optional`, the current design can leverage all of the
  functionality of `optional`, including `value_or` and monadic operations. Any
  future improvements to `optional` could be accessed by users of `map::get`
  without modifying `map`.  In particular, all of the features in [@P1255]
  could be applied to the return value of `map::get`, including a
  `std::reference_or` function.
- The current version has a single observer (`get`) compared to two observers
   for the R0 design (`get` and `get_ref`).  Since
   each observer requires four overloads (`const` and non-`const`, each having
   a `key_type` or templated `K` parameter), the interface simplification is
   notable.
- The current specification of `get` is simple to specify and implement, making
  `get` easy to add to nonstandard map-like containers and new standard
  containers such as `flat_map` and even for random-access sequence containers,
  including `vector` and `deque`, should the committee choose to do that.

During the
[2024-02-27 LEWGI (SG18) telecon](https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21telecons2024/P3091#Library-Evolution-2024-02-27),
unanimous consent was achieved for `get` returning `optional<T&>` (known as the
Alternative Design in [@P3091R0]):

> POLL: The alternative design with a smaller container API with extensions to
> `std::optional` should be pursued.

Free Functions Instead of Members
---------------------------------

Providing the functionality described in this paper is possible using
namespace-scope functions, without modifying `std::map` and
`std::unordered_map`:

```cpp
template <class Map, class K, class... Args>
  typename optional<typename Map::mapped_type&> get(Map& m, const K& k);
template <class Map, class K, class... Args>
  typename optional<const typename Map::mapped_type&> get(const Map& m, const K& k);

auto x = get(m, k).value_or(v);
```

One benefit to this approach is that the namespace-scoped `get` template can
handle any *map-like* dictionary type (i.e., a type having a `mapped_type` and
a `find` method that returns an `iterator` pointing to a key-value
`pair`). Such an approach, however, has disadvantages.

 - A global function is less intuitive because it puts `get` outside of the map
   interface.
 - The short name can cause ADL issues.
 - The *map-like* concept is novel and not used elsewhere in the Standard.
   Whether many classes model this concept and would therefore benefit from the
   generality is unclear.
