Abstract
========

The most convenient way to look up an element of a `map` or `unordered_map` is
to use the index operator, i.e., `theMap[key]`. This operator cannot be used,
however, when 1) the container is `const`, 2) the mapped type is not default
constructible, 3) the default-constructed <!-- lah: the first occurrence of
default construct... on this line is a predicate adj and gets no hyphen, and
the second is an adjective and does get a hyphen, so though the discrepancy
might seem like an error, whether we hyphenate depends on the *function* of the
term in the sentence. --> value is inappropriate for the context, or 4) the
container should not be  modified. These limitations often force the user to
resort to the `find` member function, which returns an iterator that points to
a `pair` and typically leads to more complex code having at least one `if`
statement and/or duplicate lookup operations. Taking inspiration from other
languages, especially Python, this paper proposes a `get` member function that
returns `optional<T&>` and leverages the observers and monadic operations of
`optional` to simplify lookups for `map` and `unordered_map`. In addition, a
new `or_construct` observer function is proposed for `optional` to expand the
set of common use-cases for `get`.  Note that this proposal is built on
`optional<T&>`, which is described in [@P2988R3] and is not yet in the C++
Working Draft.

Change Log
==========

**R1** (post 2024-02-27 LEWGI teleconference)

- As a result of discussions in LEWGI on 27 Feb 2024, the return value of `get`
  was changed from `mapped_type` to `optional<mapped_type&>`, and the
  functionality of `get_ref` and `get_as` were delegated to `optional`. Note
  that `optional<T&>` is not valid in C++23 but is proposed in [@P2988R3] for
  C++26.
- Added a proposed `or_construct` member to `optional`
- Proposed an enhancement of `optional<T&>::value_or` over that in [@P2988R3]
- Added feature-test macros

**R0** (pre-Tokyo mailing)

- Initial version

Motivation
==========

Just about every modern computer language has, as part of the language or its
standard library, one or more associative containers that uniquely map a key to
a value, variously called `map`, `hash_map`, `dictionary`, or something
similar. In C++, we have `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`, and eventually <!--
lah: "eventually" implies "not yet." If that's true, leave as is. If that's not
true, you might want to reword. --> (per [@P0429R9] and [@P2767R2])
`std::flat_map`. The easy-to-write and easy-to-read expression for getting a
value for an associated key is simply `theMap[key]`; in other words, a mapped
value is retrieved (and often set) using the index operator, which returns a
reference to the value associated with the key. Unfortunately, the index
operator in the C++ associative containers has a number of shortcomings
compared to many other languages.

* It works only for non-`const` containers.
* It works only for default-constructible mapped types.
* The default-constructed object (when available) is not always the correct
  identity for a given use case.
* It modifies the container when the key is absent.

Consider a `std::map` named `theMap` that maps an integer key to
a floating-point value, modeling a sparse array of `double`. If we want to find
the largest of the `double` values mapped to the integer keys in the range 1 to
100, we might be tempted to write the following loop:

```cpp
double largest = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
  largest = std::max(largest, theMap[i]);
```

If `theMap` is `const`, the loop will not compile. If any of the keys in the
range `[1, 100]` are absent from the map, then `theMap[i]` will return a
default-constructed `double` having value 0.0, which might or might not be
desirable, depending on whether we want to treat missing values as truly having
value 0.0 or to ignore them (or, equivalently, to treat them as having value
*-infinity*). <!-- lah: text for negative infinity looks odd, like
hyphen[space]infinity. Perhaps set as math, $-\infinity$, so we get the true
minus sign (which is slightly longer than a hyphen) and an infinity symbol. -->
Finally if, before executing this loop, `theMap` contains only, say, five
entries, then at the end of the loop, it will contain at least 100 entries,
most of whose values will be zero.

Some alternatives avoid all these shortcomings but are significantly less
elegant and therefore more error prone.  For example, the `at` member function
looks a lot like `operator[]` and has none of the above shortcomings, but
missing keys are handled by throwing exceptions, making this option impractical
for situations other than when the key is almost certain to exist. Moreover, a
`try`-`catch` block within a loop is rarely a clean way to structure code:

```cpp
double largest = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
{
  try {
    largest = std::max(largest, theMap.at(i));
  } catch (const std::out_of_range&) { }
}
```

The above code would work with a `const` map, would ignore missing elements
(rather than treating them as zeros), and would not populate the map with
useless entries, but many programmers would argue that the loop is inelegant at
best. In most C++ implementations, this code would be extremely inefficient
unless key misses are rare.

The other obvious alternative uses the `find` member function:

```cpp
double largest = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
{
  auto iter = theMap.find(i);
  if (iter != theMap.end())
    largest = std::max(largest, iter->second);
}
```

This version of the loop is only slightly more verbose than our starting point
and avoids all the issues, but using iterators, needing to call *two* member
functions (`find` and `end`), and having to extract the `second` member of the
element `pair` for what should be a *simple* operation increases the cognitive
load on both the programmer and the reader. Moreover, a generic use of `find`
can yield a subtle bug.  Consider the following function template, `f`:

```cpp
template <class Key, class Value>
void f(const Key& k, const std::map<Key, Value>& aMap)
{
  Value obj = @_some-default-obj-value-expression_@;
  auto iter = aMap.find(k);
  if (iter != aMap.end())
    obj = iter->second;
  // code that uses `obj` ...
}
```

An instantiation of `f` will not compile unless `Value` is copy assignable.
Worse, unless tested with a nonassignable type, the bug could go undetected for
a long time. One fix would be initialize `obj` in a single expression:

```cpp
Value obj = aMap.count(k) ? aMap.at(k) : @_some-default-obj-value-expression_@;
```

While correct, this solution involves two lookup operations: one for the
`count` and one for the `at`.  <!-- lah: the rule for colons is that if the
clause that follows the colon is a complete sentence, then it gets an initial
cap. If it is a fragment, it starts with a lowercase letter. --> A better fix
requires a bit more code:

```cpp
auto iter = aMap.find(k);
Value obj = iter != aMap.end() ? iter->second : @_some-default-obj-value-expression_@;
```

Note that the last solution again involves `iterator`, `pair`, and a
conditional expression, which is a far cry from the simplicity of `operator[]`.

Let's contrast these less-than-ideal map lookups to dictionary lookups in
Python and consider one way to write the largest-value computation in Python:

```python
inf = float("inf")
largest = -inf
for i in range(1, 101):
    largest = max(largest, theMap.get(i, -inf))
```

The `get` member of Python's dictionary type looks up the supplied key (first
argument). If the key exists in the dictionary, it <!-- lah: what is "it"? the
key? the `get` member? --> returns the corresponding value; otherwise, `get`
returns the specified alternative value (second argument).

In this paper, I propose a `get` member function for `std::map` and
`std::unordered_map` similar to the `get` member in Python
dictionaries. Because C++ does not have a `None` value like Python's, `get`
returns an `optional` instead and delegates the construction of an alternative
return value to the `optional`.

Proposed Feature
================

Overview
--------

What's desired is a simple expression that, given a key, returns the mapped
value if the key exists in a specific map and a user-supplied *alternative
value* if the key does not exist. The proposed feature is a `get` member
function for `map` and `unordered_map` that returns `optional<T&>` (or, for a
`const` map, `optional<const T&>`):

```cpp
template<class Key, class T, class Compare = less<Key>,
         class Allocator = allocator<pair<const Key, T>>>
class map {
  // ...
  optional<      mapped_type&> get(const key_type& k);
  optional<const mapped_type&> get(const key_type& k) const;
  //...
};
```

These functions depend on having an `optional` template that can be
instantiated with reference types, as proposed in [@P2988R3].

Using this feature, the earlier example could be rewritten:

```cpp
double negative_inf = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
double largest = negative_inf;
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
  largest = std::max(largest, theMap.get(i).value_or(negative_inf));
```

Returning a Different but Compatible Reference Type
---------------------------------------------------

The return value of `value_or` is `T&` (as proposed in [@P2988R3]). That means
that the returned value can be modified, which can be very useful even though
the modification does not always affect the `map`:

```cpp
std::map<std::string, int> theMap{ ... };
// Increment the entries matching `names` but only if they are already in `theMap`.
for (const std:string& name : names) {
  int temp = 0;
  ++theMap.get(name).value_or(temp);  // increment through reference
  // Possibly-modified value of `temp` is discarded.
}
```

Sometimes, however, the definition of `value_or` for `optional<T&>` described
in [@P2988R3] is difficult to use. If `T` is non-const, a valid-looking <!--
lah: "valid-looking" implies that perhaps it actually is not valid. Is that
what you intended? --> and useful call could be rejected by the compiler:

```cpp
const int zero = 0;
std::optional<int&> x;
const int& r1 = x.value_or(zero);  // Error: `const int&` not convertible to `int&`
const int& r2 = std::optional<const int&>(x).value_or(zero);  // OK
```

The error when constructing <!-- lah: the error itself is not doing the
constructing, so make sure my change is what you intended. --> `r1` is
annoying, and the workaround for `r2` is inelegant. Having
`optional<T&>::value_or(U&&)` return an lvalue of type `common_reference_t<T&,
U>` would be much more convenient and would remain safe.  Modifying
`value_or` in this way would allow not only `const` lvalue arguments, but also
base classes of `T`:

```cpp
struct Base { ... }
struct Derived : Base { ... };

Base alt{ ... };
std::opt<Derived&> theOpt;
auto& ref = theOpt.value_or(alt);  // `ref` has type `Base&`.
```

This change to `optional<T&>::value_or` has been suggested to the authors of
P2988 and is also part of the wording in this paper.

Returning an Rvalue
-------------------

Revisiting the earlier example for finding the largest entry in a range, we
note that, although `value_or` works when passed an lvalue,

```cpp
  largest = std::max(largest, theMap.get(i).value_or(@**negative_inf**@));
```

the following code will not compile, even though it appears to be equivalent:

```cpp
  largest = std::max(largest, theMap.get(i).value_or(@**-std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()**@);
```

The problem is that when an `optional` holds a reference, the argument to
`value_or` must be an lvalue of compatible type, whereas `infinity()` returns
an rvalue. Moreover, even for an `optional` that holds a nonreference,
`value_or` accepts only a single argument rather than an `emplace`-like list of
constructor arguments, potentially requiring that the return value be first
constructed, then moved (or worse, copied). Both problems are solved with an
additional `or_construct` member function that has a variadic list of
constructor arguments and returns an rvalue by default, regardless of whether
`T` is a reference:

```cpp
template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>
  U or_construct(Args&&... args);
template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>
  U or_construct(Args&&... args) const;
```

The return value for `or_construct` is constructed from the `optional` value if
`has_value()` is true; otherwise, it is constructed from
`std::forward<Args>(args)...`:

Using `or_construct` instead of `value_or` would yield this working code:

```cpp
double largest = -std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity();
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; ++i)
  largest = std::max(largest,
                     theMap.get(i).@**or_construct**@(-std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity()));
```

Returning a Type Other Than `mapped_type`
-----------------------------------------

Although the return type of `optional<T>::or_construct` defaults to `T`, the
user can explicitly specify a different return type. This feature is useful
when the desired type is *convertible from* `T` and where a more efficient
construction is possible for the alternative value. An emblematic example is
`std::string_view`. Constructing a `string_view` directly from a `char` array
or directly from an `std::string` is efficient, but first converting a `char`
array to `std::string` *and then* constructing a `string_view` from the
resulting `string` is inefficient. By specifying `std::string_view` as the
return type, `or_construct` can be called with `std::string` as `T` and
`char[]` as the alternative value, without generating temporary objects:

```cpp
std::optional<std::string> theOpt;
std::string_view sv1 = theOpt.or_construct<std::string_view>("empty");

std::map<int, std::string> theMap{ ... };
std::string_view sv2 = theMap.get(key).or_construct<std::string_view>("none");
```

The example above creates the resulting `std::string_view` objects either from
the `std::string` stored in the `optional` or from the `const char[]` passed as
the alternative value, without creating an intervening `std::string`. Not only
would conversion to an intermediate `std::string` be inefficient, such a
conversion would create problems with object lifetimes:

```cpp
// BUG (silent): dangling reference constructing `string_view` from temporary `string`
std::string_view sv1 = theOpt.or_construct("none");

// ERROR (ill-formed): cannot convert `char[]` rvalue to `string` lvalue
std::string_view sv2 = theMap.get(key).value_or("none");
```

<!-- lah: In the rendered html, why is BUG not ital and ERROR is? -->

If the specified return type is a reference, then `or_construct` behaves much
like `value_or` except that the return type is exactly the specified type,
rather than the deduced common reference type between `T&` and the alternative
argument:

```cpp
std::optional<int&> theOpt;
const int zero = 0;

auto& v1 = theOpt.value_or(zero);                 // OK
auto& v2 = theOpt.or_construct<int&>(zero);       // ERROR: `const` mismatch
auto& v3 = theOpt.or_construct<const int&>(zero); // OK
```

Before and After Comparisons
========================

The following table shows how operations are simplified using the proposed new
member functions. In these examples, `K`, `T`, and `U` are object types; `m` is
an object of (possibly `const`) `std::map<K, T>`, `unordered_map<K, T>`, or
`flat_map<K, T>`; `k` is a value compatible with `K`; `v` is an lvalue of type
(possibly `const`) `T`; and `a1..aN` are arguments that can used to construct
an object of type `T`.

Alternatives Considered
=======================

Names
-----

The name `map::get` is borrowed from the Python dictionary member of the same
name.  Other names considered were `get_optional`, `lookup`, and
`lookup_optional`. The `get` name was selected for brevity and familiarity,
but `lookup` is also concise and is a reasonable alternative.

The name `optional<T>::or_construct` was selected for consistency with the
monadic operations `and_then` and `or_else`.  However, we might consider
`value_or_construct` as an intuitive extension of `value_or`.

Build Get-Value-or-Return-Alternative Functionality Directly into `map`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version R0 of this paper proposed `get`, `get_ref`, and `get_as` member
functions that would look up a key and return the corresponding value (or a
reference to the corresponding value) or else construct an alternative from the
nonkey arguments without involving `optional<T&>`:

```cpp
template <class... Args>
  mapped_type get(const key_type& key, Args&&... args) const;

// return by reference
template <class Arg>
  common_reference_t<mapped_type&,       Arg> get_ref(const key_type& key, Arg&& ref);
template <class Arg>
  common_reference_t<const mapped_type&, Arg> get_ref(const key_type& key, Arg&& ref) const;

template <class U, class... Args>
  U get_as(const key_type& key, Args&&... args);
template <class U, class... Args>
  U get_as(const key_type& key, Args&&... args) const;
```

That the `get_as` functionality could be merged into `get` by adding a
defaulted `U` parameter to `get` was later pointed out: <!-- lah: would be best
if we could rewrite as "X later pointed out that..." where is a paper or person
or whatever. -->

```cpp
template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>
  U get(const key_type& key, Args&&... args);
template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>
  U get(const key_type& key, Args&&... args) const;
```

**Advantages of the R0 Design Over the Current Design**

- R0 provides more concise and readable calls to `get` and `get_ref` in many
  cases.
- The desired return-value-if-present-else-return-alternative functionality is
  all specified in one place in the R0 design, exactly where a beginner would
  look for it.
- R0 `map` and `unordered_map` specification changes would be independent of
  `optional`.

**Advantages of the Current Design Over the R0 Design**

- The current `get` provides a direct indication, via a disengaged `optional`
  return value, that the key was not found.
- By returning `optional`, the current design can leverage all of the
  functionality of `optional`, including `value_or` and monadic operations. Any
  future improvements to `optional` could be accessed by users of `map::get`
  without modifying `map`.
- The current version has a single observer (`get`) compared to two observers
   for R0 (`get` and `get_ref`, assuming `get_as` is merged into `get`).  Since
   each observer requires four overloads (`const` and non-`const`, each having
   a `key_type` or templated `K` parameter), the interface simplification is
   noticeable.
- The current specification of `get` is simple to specify and implement, making
  `get` <!-- lah: make sure I understood what you intended by "it" --> easy to
  add to nonstandard map-like containers and new standard containers such as
  `flat_map`.
- The current interface can be applied not only to associative map-like
  containers, but to any indexable container, including `vector` and `deque`,
  if we <!-- lah: who is "we"? the Committee? --> choose to do that.

unanimous consent was achieved for `get` returning `optional<T&>` (known as the
Alternative Design in [@P3091R0]): <!-- lah: I think AM mentioned to me in a
different paper that some Committee rule forbids putting polling results in

Combine `optional<T>::value_or` and `optional<T>::or_construct`
---------------------------------------------------------------

Adding a variadic parameter list to
`value_or` so that more than one constructor argument could be passed at once would be theoretically possible and would
obviate `or_construct` as a separate member.  However, when `T` is a
reference, [@P2988R3] says that the return value of `value_or` is also a
reference. Passing multiple constructor arguments to `value_or` requires
returning an rvalue. While automatically
determining the value category (rvalue or lvalue) returned by `value_or` is theoretically possible, such a
definition would be confusing, especially to a human reader, who must analyze
the code carefully to determine whether non-`const` operations on the returned
entity might inadvertently change a value in the original `optional`.

Lazy Evaluation of `or_construct` Argument
------------------------------------------

The map lookup functionality described in this paper was implemented as free
utility functions in [@Folly]. Specifically, the `folly::map_default(@_map_,
_key_, _dflt_@)` function behaves similar to the `@_map_@.get(@_key_, _dflt_@)`
function proposed in R0 of this paper. Folly, however, goes one step further:
If `@_dflt_@` is a functor taking no arguments and returns a value convertible
to `mapped_type`, then the functor is invoked if and only if the key is not
found in the map; i.e., the alternative value is computed *lazily* when needed.

If such lazy evaluation is desired within the framework of this proposal, the
functionality would be added to `optional<T>::or_construct`. Although not
directly related to map lookups, I would consider extending this proposal
accordingly.

Free Functions Instead of Members
---------------------------------

Providing the functionality described in this paper is possible using
namespace-scope functions, without modifying `std::map` and
`std::unordered_map`:

```cpp
template <class Map, class K, class... Args>
  typename optional<typename Map::mapped_type&> get(Map& m, const K& k);
template <class Map, class K, class... Args>
  typename optional<const typename Map::mapped_type&> get(const Map& m, const K& k);

auto x = get(m, k).value_or(v);
```

One benefit to this approach is that the namespace-scoped `get` template can
handle any *map-like* dictionary type (i.e., a type having a `mapped_type` and
a `find` method that returns an `iterator` pointing to a key-value
`pair`). Such an approach, however, has disadvantages.

 - This method is less intuitive because it puts `get` outside of the map
   interface.
 - The short name can cause ADL issues.
 - The *map-like* concept is novel and not used elsewhere in the Standard.
   Whether many classes model this concept and would therefore benefit from the
   generality is unclear.

Moving the `construct_or` functionality out of `optional` makes even less sense
given that only one `optional` exists, so making any core observer into a free
function would offer no benefit.

Changes to `optional`
---------------------

In [optional.optional.general]{.sref} *in the Working Draft*, insert the `or_construct`
observer after `value_or`:

>| `template<class U> constexpr T value_or(U&&) const &;`
>| `template<class U> constexpr T value_or(U&&) &&;`
::: add
>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>`
>|     `U constexpr or_construct(Args&&...);`
>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>`
>|     `U constexpr or_construct(Args&&...) const;`
>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class X, class... Args>`
>|     `U constexpr or_construct(initializer_list<X>, Args&&...);`
>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class X, class... Args>`
>|     `U constexpr or_construct(initializer_list<X>, Args&&...) const;`
:::

In the `optional<T&>` wording *in [@P2988R3]*, change
`value_or` and add `or_construct` to [optional.optional.general]:

>| `template<class U> constexpr` [`T&`]{.rm} [*see below*]{.add} `value_or(U&&) const;`
::: add
>| `template <class U = remove_cv_t<T>, class... Args>`
>|     `U or_construct(Args&&...) const;`
>| `template <class U = remove_cv_t<T>, class X, class... Args>`
>|     `U constexpr or_construct(initializer_list<X>, Args&&...) const;`
:::


At the end of [optional.observe]{.sref} *in the Working Draft*, add the definition of
`or_construct`:

::: add
>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>`
>|     `U or_construct(Args&&... args);`
>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class... Args>`
>|     `U or_construct(Args&&... args) const;`

>> *Mandates*: `is_constructible_v<U, decltype(**this)> &&`
>> `is_constructible_v<U, Args...>` \
>> is `true`. If `U` is an lvalue reference type, then `sizeof...(Args)` is
>> `1` and, for `A0` being \
>> the single type in `Args`, `is_lvalue_reference_v<A0> &&` \
>> `is_convertible_v<add_pointer_t<A0>, add_pointer_t<U>> &&` \
>> `is_convertible_v<add_pointer_t<T>, add_pointer_t<U>>` is `true`.

>> *Effects*: Equivalent to:

>>> `return has_value() ? U(**this) : U(std::forward<Args>(args)...);`

>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class X, class... Args>`
>|     `U constexpr or_construct(initializer_list<X> il, Args&&...);`
>| `template <class U = remove_cvref_t<T>, class X, class... Args>`
>|     `U constexpr or_construct(initializer_list<X> il, Args&&...) const;`

>> *Mandates*: `! is_reference_v<U> &&`
>> `is_constructible_v<U, initializer_list<X>, Args...> &&` \
>> `is_constructible_v<U, decltype(**this)>` is `true`.

>> *Effects*: Equivalent to:

>>> `return has_value() ? U(**this) : U(il, std::forward<Args>(args)...);`

:::

In the `optional<T&>` wording *in [@P2988R3]*, change the
definition of `value_or` and add the definition of `or_construct` to
[optional.observe] :

>| `template<class U> constexpr` [`T&`]{.rm} [*see below*]{.add} `value_or(U&& v) const;`

>> [The return type is `common_reference_t<add_lvalue_reference_t<T>,
>> decltype(v)>`. Let *R* designate the return type.]{.add}

>> *Mandates*: [`is_constructible_v<add_lvalue_reference_t<T>, decltype(v)>` is
>> `true`]{.rm} \
>> [*R* is well formed and is an lvalue reference type.
>> `is_convertible_v<add_pointer_t<T>, add_pointer_t<@*R*@>> &&`
>> `is_convertible_v<add_pointer_t<U>, add_pointer_t<@*R*@>>` is `true`]{.add}.

>> *Effects*: Equivalent to:

>>> `return has_value() ?` [`static_cast<@*R*@>(`]{.add}`value()`[`)`]{.add} `:` [`static_cast<@*R*@>(`]{.add}`forward<U>(u)`[`)`]{.add}`;`

::: add
>> *Remark*: This function participates in overload resolution even when

::: add
>| `template <class U = T, class... Args>`
>|     `U or_construct(Args&&...args) const;`

Changes to `map` and `unordered_map`
------------------------------------

In [map.overview]{.sref}/2, insert the `get` element-access members:

>| `//` _[map.access]{.sref}, element access_
>| `mapped_type& operator[](const key_type& x);`
>| `mapped_type& operator[](key_type&& x);`
>| `template<class K> mapped_type& operator[](K&& x);`
>| `mapped_type&       at(const key_type& x);`
>| `const mapped_type& at(const key_type& x) const;`
>| `template<class K> mapped_type&       at(const K& x);`
>| `template<class K> const mapped_type& at(const K& x) const;`
::: add
>| `optional<mapped_type&>       get(const key_type& x) noexcept;`

>| `template<class K> optional<mapped_type&>       get(const K& x) noexcept;`
>| `template<class K> optional<const mapped_type&> get(const K& x) const noexcept;`
:::

At the end of [map.access]{.sref}, add these descriptions:

::: add
>| `optional<mapped_type&>       get(const key_type& x) noexcept;`
>| `optional<const mapped_type&> get(const key_type& x) const noexcept;`
>| `template<class K> optional<mapped_type&>       get(const K& x) noexcept;`
>| `template<class K> optional<const mapped_type&> get(const K& x) const noexcept;`

>> `Compare::is_transparent` is valid and denotes a type.

>> *Preconditions*: The expression `find(x)` is well formed and has
>> well-defined behavior.

>> *Returns*: `find(x)->second` if `find(x) == end()` is `false`, otherwise
>> `nullopt`.

>> *Complexity*: Logarithmic
:::

In [unord.map.overview]{.sref}/3, insert the `get`
element-access members:

>| `//` _[unord.map.elem]{.sref}, element access_
>| `mapped_type& operator[](const key_type& x);`
>| `mapped_type& operator[](key_type&& x);`
>| `template<class K> mapped_type& operator[](K&& x);`

>| `template<class K> optional<const mapped_type&> get(const K& x) const noexcept;`
:::

At the end of [unord.map.elem]{.sref}, add these descriptions:

::: add
>| `optional<mapped_type&>       get(const key_type& x) noexcept;`
>| `optional<const mapped_type&> get(const key_type& x) const noexcept;`
