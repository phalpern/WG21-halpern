Abstract
========

The `inplace_vector` proposal, [@P0843R10], is moving forward without allocator
support. This paper proposes that `inplace_vector` *should* have allocator
support and explores the pros and cons of adding such support directly into
`inplace_vector` vs. into a separate `basic_inplace_vector` class template.
This proposal is distinct from [@P0843R10] so that the latter can move forward
quickly while allocator-specific policies are still being resolved.

Motivation
==========

General Motivation for Allocator-Aware Types
--------------------------------------------

*Note: The text below is borrowed nearly verbatim from [@P3002R1], which
proposes a general policy for when types should use allocators.*

Memory management is a major part of building software. Numerous facilities in
the C++ Standard library exist to give the programmer maximum control over how
their program uses memory.

* `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` are parameterized with *deleter*
  objects that control, among other things, how memory resources are reclaimed.

* `std::vector` is preferred over other containers in many cases because its
  use of contiguous memory provides optimal cache locality and minimizes
  allocate and deallocate operations. Indeed, the LEWG has spent a lot of time
  on `flat_set` ([@P1222R0]) and `flat_map` ([@P0429R3]), whose underlying
  structure defaults, for this reason, to `vector`.

* Operators `new` and `delete` are replaceable, giving programmers global
  control over how memory is allocated.

* The C++ object model makes a clear distinction between an object's memory
  footprint and its lifetime.

* Language constructs such as `void*` and `reinterpet_cast` provide
  fine-grained access to objects' underlying memory.

* Standard containers and strings are parameterized with allocators, providing
  object-level control over memory allocation and element construction.

This fine-grained control over memory that C++ gives the programmer is a large
part of why C++ is applicable to so many domains --- from embedded systems with
limited memory budgets to games, high-frequency trading, and scientific
simulations that require cache locality, thread affinity, and other
memory-related performance optimizations.

An in-depth description of the value proposition for allocator-aware software
can be found in [@P2035R0].  Standard containers are the most ubiquitous
examples of *allocator-aware* types. Their `allocator_type` and `get_allocator`
members and allocator-parameterized constructors allow them to be used like
building blocks that can be combined and nested as necessary while retaining
full programmer control over how the whole assembly allocates memory. For
*scoped allocators* (i.e., those that apply not only to the top-level
container, but also to its elements), having each element of a container
support a predictable allocator-aware interface is crucial to giving the
programmer the ability to allocate all memory from a single memory resource,
such as an arena or pool. Note that the allocator is a *configuration*
parameter of an object and does not contribute to its value.

In short, four principles underlie this policy proposal.

1. **The Standard Library should be general and flexible**. The user of a
   library class should have control, to the greatest extent possible, over how
   memory is allocated.

2. **The Standard Library should be consistent**. The use of allocators should
   be consistent with the existing allocator-aware classes and class templates,
   especially those in the containers library.

3. **The parts of the Standard Library should work together**. If one part of
   the library gives the user control over memory allocation but another part
   does not, then the second part undermines the utility of the first.

4. **The Standard Library should encapsulate complexity**. The generic
   application of allocators with maximum flexibility is potentially complex
   and is best left to the experts implementing the Standard Library.  Users
   can choose their own subset of desirable allocator behavior only if the
   underlying Library classes allow them to choose their preferred approach,
   whether it be stateless allocators, statically typed allocators, polymorphic
   allocators, or no allocators.

Motivation for an Allocator-Aware `inplace_vector`
--------------------------------------------------

The main motivations for `inplace_vector` as a whole are to give the user
control over memory allocation. If such a type did not fit into an existing
infrastructure that is also designed to give the user control over memory use,
that would certainly seem ironic.

Although the objects stored in an `std::inplace_vector`, as proposed in
[@P0843R10], can be emplaced with any set of valid constructor arguments,
including allocator arguments, the fact that the `inplace_vector` itself is not
allocator aware prevents it from working consistently with other parts of the
Standard Library, specifically those parts that depend on *uses-allocator
construction* (section [allocator.uses.construction]) in the Standard:

```
pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource rsrc;
pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> alloc{ &rsrc };
using V = inplace_vector<pmr::string, 10>;
V v = make_obj_using_allocator<V>(alloc, { "hello", "goodbye" });
assert(v[0].get_allocator() == alloc);  // FAILS
```

Even though an allocator is supplied, it is not used to construct the
`pmr::string` objects within the resulting `inplace_vector` object because
`inplace_vector` does not have the necessary hooks for
`make_obj_using_allocator` to recognize it as being allocator aware.  Note
that, although this example and the ones that follow use
`pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, the same issues would apply to any scoped
allocator.

*Uses-allocator construction* is rarely used directly in user code.  Instead,
it is used within the implementation of standard containers and scoped
allocators to ensure that the allocator used to construct the container is also
used to construct its elements.  Continuing the example above, consider what
happens if an `inplace_vector` is stored in a `pmr::vector` compared to
truly allocator-aware type (`pmr::string`) in a `pmr::vector`:

```
pmr::vector<pmr::string> vs(alloc);
pmr::vector<V>           vo(alloc);

vs.emplace_back("hello");
vo.emplace_back({ "hello" });

assert(vs.back().get_allocator() == alloc);      // OK
assert(vo.back()[0]->get_allocator() == alloc);  // FAILS
```

An important invariant when using a scoped allocator such as
`pmr::polymorphic_allocator` is that the same allocator is used throughout an
object hierarchy. `inplace_vector` cannot ensure that this invariant is
preserved, even if each element is originally inserted with the correct
allocator, because `inplace_vector` does not remember the allocator used to
construct it and thus cannot supply the allocator to new elements. The
abstraction has become unreliable and the programmer must manually enforce the
scoped-allocator invariant.

Proposal Summary
================

The proposal offered here is to make `inplace_vector` an *allocator-aware
container* as described in [container.alloc.reqmts]{.sref} and as specified
below.

* The class template would have a third template argument, `Allocator`, which
  would default to `std::allocator<T>`. The `std::pmr` namespace would also
  contain an alias:

> ```cpp
> template <class T, size_t N, class Allocator = allocator<T>>
> class inplace_vector; // partially freestanding
>
> namespace pmr
> {
>   template <class T, size_t N>
>   using inplace_vector = std::inplace_vector<T, N, polymorphic_allocator<T>>;
> }
> ```

* The interface would add `allocator_type` and `get_allocator` members:

> ```cpp
> using allocator_type = Allocator;
>
> constexpr allocator_type get_allocator() const;
> ```

* Every constructor would have either an overload or a default argument
  allowing the allocator to be passed as its last argument:

> ```cpp
> constexpr inplace_vector() noexcept;
> constexpr explicit inplace_vector(const allocator_type& a) noexcept;
> constexpr explicit inplace_vector(size_type n); // freestanding-deleted
> constexpr inplace_vector(size_type n,
>                          const allocator_type& a); // freestanding-deleted
> constexpr inplace_vector(size_type n, const T& value,
>                          const allocator_type& a = {}); // freestanding-deleted
> // etc..
> ```

* If the element type, `T`, uses the specified allocator (i.e.,
  `uses_allocator_v<T, Allocator>` is `true`), then the allocator is passed to
  the constructor of `T` via *uses-allocator construction*
  ([allocator.uses.construction]{.sref}) when elements are inserted into the
  `inplace_vector`.

Design Decision for Discussion
------------------------------

For wrapper types such as `tuple<T>`, an allocator passed to the constructor is
passed through to the wrapped `T` object via *uses-allocator construction*
([allocator.uses.construction]{.sref}), regardless of whether the allocator is a
scoped allocator.  The reasoning is that, since the `tuple` does not itself
allocate memory, passing in an allocator that is compatible
with `T` but which is not passed to the wrapped `T` object makes no sense.  The same logic
applies to the proposed `basic_optional` and `basic_variant` templates proposed
in [@P2047R7] and [@P3153R0], respectively.

On the other hand, the requirements on an allocator-aware container in
[container.alloc.reqmts]{.sref} indicate that elements should always be
constructed using `allocator_traits<Allocator>::construct`. A nonintuitive
downside of following this convention is that only an allocator having a
special `construct` method, such as a scoped allocator, would be used to
construct elements; other allocator types would effectively be ignored (but
they might take up space in the object footprint). The main upside, however, is
that the existing wording in [allocator.uses.construction]{.sref} would apply
unchanged, including the definitions of *Cpp17DefaultInsertable*,
*Cpp17MoveInsertable*, *Cpp17CopyInsertable*, *Cpp17EmplaceConstructible*, and
*Cpp17Erasable*.

To summarize:

* *Uses-allocator construction* is consistent with other nonallocating types
  that contain allocating types.

* `allocator_traits<Allocator>::construct` is consistent with other containers,
  including `std::vector`.

* For most scoped allocators, including `pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, the two
  designs are equivalent. If a scoped allocator uses different allocation
  mechanisms at different nesting levels, however, `construct` will use the
  top level mechanism to construct objects, but not to allocate memory.

* Workarounds employing the `scoped_allocator_adaptor` would let each design
  behave like the other.

The design in this document constructs elements via *uses-allocator
construction*, but LEWG should consider this issue carefully, including in the
context of a larger policy discussion.


Alternatives Considered
=======================

Several possible designs for an allocator-aware `inplace_vector` have been
considered.  Option 1 --- with none of its suboptions --- is being proposed
here.

Option 1: `inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc = std::allocator<T>>`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The allocator would be stored in the object and returned by `get_allocator()`.
If `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true, then elements are constructed via
*uses-allocator construction* with the supplied allocator. For
`std::allocator`, no space would be need to be taken up; in fact, consuming no
space should be a *requirement* so that `sizeof(inplace_vector<T, N>)` is
guaranteed to be *N* * `sizeof(T)`, i.e., no size overhead for the default
allocator case.

**Pros**: This option offers the simplest design, is most consistent with other
containers, and has zero runtime overhead for the default case.

**Cons**: If `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is false and `Alloc` is a nonempty
class, then space is wasted storing an unused allocator.

**Suboptions for reducing wasted footprint storage** for non-AA elements:

a. In this case, `inplace_vector` could be non-allocator-aware,
   `allocator_type` and `get_allocator()` would not be defined, and no
   constructors would accept an allocator argument.

b. Supplying an allocator other than `std::allocator` for a type that cannot
   use it could be ill-formed.

Unfortunately, both sub-options would make generic programming somewhat more
difficult.

Option 2: `inplace_vector<class T, size_t N>`
---------------------------------------------

If `T::allocator_type` exists, then `inplace_vector<class T, size_t
N>::allocator_type` would also exist, as would `get_allocator()` and
allocator-accepting constructors.  Otherwise, the instantiation would not be
allocator aware.

**Pros**: The user cannot accidentally forget to specify an allocator parameter
when using allocator-aware element types.

**Cons**: If `T` is allocator aware but the user doesn't want to take advantage
of that quality, an allocator is stored unnecessarily.  Worse, no obvious
workarounds are available to avoid storing and using an allocator. This
approach is inconsistent with other containers; nowhere else in the Standard
does a container-element's allocator type influence the allocator type of the
container itself.

Option 3: `inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc =` *see below* `>`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *see below* type is `T::allocator_type` if such a type exists and
`std::allocator<byte>` otherwise.

**Pros**: Accidentally forgetting to specify an allocator
parameter when using allocator-aware types is easily avoided (as in Option 2),
but automatic allocator selection can be easily overridden.

**Cons**: Automatically detecting the element's allocator type is novel and
inconsistent with other containers. When an allocator is not supplied by the
user, the resulting `inplace_vector` might be unintentionally allocator aware,
incurring performance penalties. Such accidents are the flip side of the Pros
for this option; some accidents are avoided while different accidents can now
occur.

Option 4: `basic_inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc>`
----------------------------------------------------------------

This approach has a separate template, `basic_inplace_vector`, that is the same
as the allocator-aware `inplace_vector` proposed in Options 1 or 3, but without
affecting the interface of `inplace_vector` proposed in [@P0843R10].

**Pros**: This option reduces complications in the `inplace_vector`
specification and implementation and potentially reduces compile time compared
to some of the preceding options.

**Cons**: `inplace_vector` and `basic_inplace_vector` are separate,
incompatible, types.  The user needs to make a decision, especially in generic
code, regarding whether they ever expect to have allocator-aware
elements. Choosing the shorter name is tempting, but comes at the expense of
breaking scoped allocation in generic code. This option increases *overall*
specification complexity and implementation because now *two* classes must be
specified, implemented, and tested, so `basic_inplace_vector` is just as
complicated as Options 1 or 3, above.

Performance and Compile-Time Costs
==================================

About the Performance Tests
---------------------------

When people talk about "low- or no-cost abstractions," they usually mean
runtime costs, but we are increasingly seeing concern about compile-time costs,
as metaprogramming and concepts allow us to express ever-more complex
constructs. Collecting data on both the runtime and compile-time costs of
adding generic allocator awareness to `inplace_vector` is, therefore, important
to aid the Committee in evaluating the options.

I performed a set of experiments with a subset of an `inplace_vector`
implementation, looking at the generated assembly code and measuring compile
times for a non-allocator-aware version, as proposed in [@P0843R10], compared
to Options 1, 2, and 3 described above. Option 4 was not measured since it
involves a completely separate class template, `basic_inplace_vector`, that
presumably would not affect the performance of the unmodified `inplace_vector`
except for the nominal cost of reading the text of the header file at
compilation time.

The [runtime](#runtime-results) and
[compile-time results](#compile-time-results) are shown below, after the
[Methodology](#methodology) section.

Methodology
-----------

Allocator awareness was added to a partial implementation of [@P0843R10]. To
save effort, only functionality needed for the test program was implemented.
For the allocator-aware versions of `inplace_vector`, compile time was reduced
marginally by implementing a partial specialization for the common case of
`std::allocator`. The test driver was designed to maximize the number of
distinct instantiations of `inplace_vector`, its constructors, and its
insertion methods (especially `push_back`), thus producing a near-worst-case
scenario for any template-instantiation penalty caused by the inclusion of the
allocator machinery.

Compilation was launched from a Python script that compiled but did not link
five identical files, each of which `#include`d the test program. Compilation
was timed for each combination of implementation option, compiler, and element
types (allocator-ware, non-allocator-aware or blended/both).  The script also
generated one assembly listing and one executable for each configuration. The
generation of the assembly and executable files was not included in the timing
tests. The executable was run as a *smoke test* to ensure that the code ran and
passed some simple tests, but the run time was too short for any meaningful
comparisons and so was not measured; runtime performance equivalence was
deduced based on assembly-language equivalence. Timing jitter was on the order
of 3-4%, so timing differences under 5% should be ignored.

The tests were run on a Lenovo ThinkPad running Ubuntu 22.04 Linux within the
Windows Subsystem for Linux. The CPU was an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-11850H running at 2.50GH with 64GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. The compilers used
in the test were GCC 11.4.0 using `-std=C++23` and Clang 14.0.0 using
`-std=C++2b`. All tests were conducted with level `-O2` optimization. The
experimental sources and scripts can be found at
[https://github.com/phalpern/WG21-halpern/tree/main/P3160-AA-inplace_vector/](https://github.com/phalpern/WG21-halpern/tree/main/P3160-AA-inplace_vector/).

Runtime Results
---------------

The test program was not designed to measure run time. Although a smoke test
was performed on each option to test that it produced correct results, run
times were too short to produce meaningful comparisons.  Instead, I compared
assembly-language output from each configuration to see if the presence of the
allocator machinery produced any difference in the generated output for both
allocator-aware element types and non-allocator-aware element types. Comparing
GCC-to-GCC and Clang-to-Clang produced the same results, shown in the table
below.

*Comparing assembly-language output against P0843R10*

|          | Non-allocator-aware `T` | Allocator-aware `T` |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Option 1 | **Identical**           | **Identical**       |
| Option 2 | **Identical**           | *Different*         |
| Option 3 | **Identical**           | *Different*         |

From this table, we can infer that the allocator machinery incurs no runtime
penalty when the element type does not use an allocator.  Moreover, Option 1
produced no penalty when the element types *do* use an allocator, provided that
the allocator was not specifically provided to `inplace_vector`, i.e., when
`inplace_vector` was instantiated with the default allocator
(`std::allocator<T>`).  Options 2 and 3 produced different results for
allocator-aware element types, as expected, since the default allocator type
for `inplace_vector<T, N>` is `T::allocator_type` in both cases, rather than
`std::allocator<T>`.

From these results, we can conclude that Option 1 produces no runtime penalty
for using the default allocator parameter; any penalty would be borne
exclusively by users that deliberately specify an allocator argument.

Compile-Time Results
--------------------

The raw data shown in the tables below present the increase in user-mode
compile time for each option when compared to the [@P0843R10] status quo. They
show that there is no appreciable compile-time penalty using any of the options
when the element type is not allocator aware (e.g., `inplace_vector<int, N>`).
Option 1 also had no penalty for allocator-aware element types when the
allocator type was left at the default `std::allocator<T>`.  Options 2 and 3
did exhibit a noticeable compile-time impact for allocator-aware elements
(e.g., `inplace_vector<pmr::string, N>`). The additional compile time can be
attributed to the machinery for passing the allocator to the elements when an
allocator is provided as well as the metaprogramming needed to determine if
`T::allocator_type` exists.

From these results, we can conclude that the allocator-aware `inplace_vector`
described in Option 1 imposes no significant compile-time cost compared to a
non-allocator-aware `inplace_vector`.

Wording
=======

Wording will be provided after initial LEWG discussion.

**Design Decisions**

- Are we are interested in an allocator-aware `inplace_vector`?

- Which interface (Options 1 -- 4) do we want?

- How should the allocator be passed to the inserted elements: via
  *uses-allocator construction* or via `allocator_traits::construct`?

**Procedural Decisions**

How should I specify wording? I can think of three possible ways (listed from
least to most effort).

1. Work with the authors of P0843 to integrate allocator wording.

2. Create a separate diff against P0843 wording.

3. Wait until P0843 has been merged with the WP and create a diff against the
   WP.
