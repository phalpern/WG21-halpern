Abstract
========

The `inplace_vector` proposal, [@P0843R10], is moving forward without allocator
support. This paper proposes that `inplace_vector` *should* have allocator
support and explores the pros and cons of adding such support direction into
`inplace_vector` vs. a separate `basic_inplace_vetor` class template. This
proposal is separate from [@P0843R10] so that the latter can move forward more
quickly, while allocator-specific policies are still being worked out.

Motivation
==========

General Motivation for Allocator-Aware Types
--------------------------------------------

*Note: The text below is borrowed nearly verbetim from [@P3002R1], which
proposes a general policy for when types should use allocators.*

Memory management is a major part of building software. Numerous facilities in
the C++ Standard library exist to give the programmer maximum control over how
their program uses memory.

* `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` are parameterized with *deleter*
  objects that control, among other things, how memory resources are reclaimed.

* `std::vector` is preferred over other containers in many cases because its
  use of contiguous memory provides optimal cache locality and minimizes
  allocate/deallocate operations. Indeed, the LEWG has spent a lot of time on
  `flat_set` ([@P1222R0]) and `flat_map`
  ([@P0429R3]), whose underlying structure defaults to
  `vector` for this reason.

* Operators `new` and `delete` are replaceable, giving programmers global
  control over how memory is allocated.

* The C++ object model makes a clear distinction between an object's memory
  footprint and its lifetime.

* Language constructs such as `void*` and `reinterpet_cast` provide
  fine-grained access to objects' underlying memory.

* Standard containers and strings are parameterized with allocators, providing
  object-level control over memory allocation and element construction.

This fine-grained control over memory that C++ gives the programmer is a large
part of why C++ is applicable to so many domains --- from embedded systems with
limited memory budgets to games, high-frequency trading, and scientific
simulations that require cache locality, thread affinity, and other
memory-related performance optimizations.

An in-depth description of the value proposition for allocator-aware software
can be found in [@P2035R0].  Standard containers are
the most ubiquitous examples of *allocator-aware* types. Their `allocator_type`
and `get_allocator` members and allocator-parameterized constructors allow them
to be used like LegoÂ® <!-- lah: not wild about the use of a trademarked name. -->
parts that can be combined and nested as necessary while
retaining full programmer control over how the whole assembly allocates
memory. For *scoped allocators*, i.e., those that apply not only to the top-level
container, but also to its elements, having each element of a container
support a predictable allocator-aware interface is crucial to giving the
programmer the ability to allocate all memory from a single memory resource,
such as an arena or pool. Note that the allocator is a *configuration*
parameter of an object and does not contribute to its value.

In short, four principles underlie this policy proposal.

1. **The Standard Library should be general and flexible**. To the extent
   possible, the user of a library class should have control over how memory is
   allocated.

2. **The Standard Library should be consistent**. The use of allocators should
   be consistent with the existing allocator-aware classes and class templates,
   especially those in the containers library.

3. **The parts of the Standard Library should work together**. If one part of
   the library gives the user control over memory allocation but another part
   does not, then the second part undermines the utility of the first.

4. **The Standard Library should encapsulate complexity**.  Fully general
   application of allocators is potentially complex and is best left to the
   experts implementing the Standard Library.  Users can choose their own
   subset of desirable allocator behavior only if the underlying Library
   classes allow them to choose their preferred approach, whether it be
   stateless allocators, statically typed allocators, polymorphic allocators,
   or no allocators.

Motivation for an Allocator-aware `inplace_vector`
--------------------------------------------------

The main motivations for `inplace_vector` as a whole are to give the user
control over memory allocation. It would seem ironic if such a type did not fit
into an existing infrastructure that is also designed to give the user control
over memory use.

Although the objects stored in an `std::inplace_vector`, as proposed in
[@P0843R10], can be emplaced with any set of valid constructor arguments,
including allocator arguments, the fact that the `inplace_vector` itself is not
allocator-aware prevents it from working consistently with other parts of the
Standard Library, specifically those parts that depend on *uses-allocator
construction* (section [allocator.uses.construction]) in the Standard:

```
pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource rsrc;
pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> alloc{ &rsrc };
using V = inplace_vector<pmr::string, 10>;
V v = make_obj_using_allocator<V>(alloc, { "hello", "goodbye" });
assert(v[0].get_allocator() == alloc);  // FAILS
```

Even though an allocator is supplied, it is not used to construct the
`pmr::string` objects within the resulting `inplace_vector` object because
`inplace_vector` does not have the necessary hooks for
`make_obj_using_allocator` to recognize it as being allocator-aware.  Note
that, although this example and the ones that follow use
`pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, the same issues would apply to any scoped
allocator.

*Uses-allocator construction* is rarely used directly in user code.  Instead,
it is used within the implementation of standard containers and scoped
allocators to ensure that the allocator used to construct the container is also
used to construct its elements.  Continuing the example above, consider what
happens if an `inplace_vector` is stored in a `pmr::vector`, compared to
storing a truly allocator-aware type (`pmr::string`):

```
pmr::vector<pmr::string> vs(alloc);
pmr::vector<V>           vo(alloc);

vs.emplace_back("hello");
vo.emplace_back({ "hello" });

assert(vs.back().get_allocator() == alloc);      // OK
assert(vo.back()[0]->get_allocator() == alloc);  // FAILS
```

An important invariant when using a scoped allocator such as
`pmr::polymorphic_allocator` is that the same allocator is used throughout an
object hierarchy. It is impossible to ensure that this invariant is preserved
when using `std::inplace_vector`, even if each element is originally inserted
with the correct allocator, because `inplace_vector` does not remember the
allocator used to construct it and cannot therefore supply the allocator to new
elements.

Proposal Summary
================

The proposal is to add `inplace_vector` an *allocator-aware container* as
described in [container.alloc.reqmts]{.sref} and as specified below.

* The class template would have a third template argument, `Allocator`, which
  would default to `std::allocator<T>`:

```cpp
template <class T, size_t N, class Allocator = allocator<T>>
class inplace_vector; // partially freestanding
```

* The interface would add `allocator_type` and `get_allocator` members:

```cpp
using allocator_type = Allocator;

constexpr allocator_type get_allocator() const;
```

* Every constructor would have either an overload or default argument allowing
  the allocator to be passed as its last argument:

```cpp
constexpr inplace_vector() noexcept;
constexpr explicit inplace_vector(const allocator_type& a) noexcept;
constexpr explicit inplace_vector(size_type n); // freestanding-deleted
constexpr inplace_vector(size_type n,
                         const allocator_type& a); // freestanding-deleted
constexpr inplace_vector(size_type n, const T& value,
                         const allocator_type& a = {}); // freestanding-deleted
// etc..
```

* If the element type, `T`, uses the specified allocator (i.e.,
  `uses_allocator_v<T, Allocator>` is `true`), then the allocator is passed to
  the constructor of `T` via *uses-allocator construction*
  ([allocator.uses.construction]{.sref}) when elements are inserted into the
  `inplace_vector`.

Design Decision for Discussion
------------------------------

For wrapper types such as `tuple<T>`, an allocator passed to the constructor is
passed through to the wrapped `T` object via *uses-allocator construction*
([allocator.uses.construction]{.sref}), regardless of whether the allocator is a
scoped allocator.  The reasoning is that, since the `tuple` does not itself
allocate memory, passing in an allocator that is compatible
with `T` but which is not passed to the wrapped `T` object makes no sense.  The same logic
applies to the proposed `basic_optional` and `basic_variant` templates proposed
in [@P2047R7] and [@P3153R0], respectively.

On the other hand, the requirements on an allocator-aware container in
[container.alloc.reqmts]{.sref} indicate that elements should always be
constructed using `allocator_traits<Allocator>::construct`. A nonintuitive
downside of following this convention is only an allocator that has a special
`construct` method, such as a scoped allocator, would be used to construct
elements; other allocator types would effectively be ignored (but they
might take up space in the object footprint). The main upside, however, is that
the existing wording in [allocator.uses.construction]{.sref} would apply
unchanged including the definitions of *Cpp17DefaultInsertable*,
*Cpp17MoveInsertable*, *Cpp17CopyInsertable*, *Cpp17EmplaceConstructible*, and
*Cpp17Erasable*.

To summarize:

* *Uses-allocator construction* is consistent with other nonallocating types
  that contain allocating types.

* `allocator_traits<Allocator>::construct` is consistent with other containers,
  including `std::vector`.

* For most scoped allocators including `pmr::polymorphic_allocator`, the two
  designs are equivalent. If a scoped allocator uses different allocation
  mechanisms at different nesting levels, however, `construct` will discard the
  top nesting level.

* There are workarounds using the `scoped_allocator_adaptor` that let each
  design behave like the other.

The design in this document constructs elements via *uses-allocator
construction*, but LEWG should consider this issue carefully, including in the
context of a larger policy discussion.


Alternatives Considered
=======================

There are several possible designs for an allocator-aware
`inplace_vector`. Option 1 is what is being proposed here --- with none of its
suboptions, although suboption (a) could be used as an implementation
optimization.

Option 1: `inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc = std::allocator<T>>`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The allocator would be stored in the object and returned by `get_allocator()`. If
`uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is true, then elements are constructed via
*uses-allocator construction* with the supplied allocator. For
`std::allocator`, no space would be need to be taken up; in fact, that should
be a requirement, so that `sizeof(inplace_vector<T, N>)` is guaranteed to be
*N* * `sizeof(T)`, i.e., no size overhead for the default allocator case.

**Pros**: Simplest design, most consistent with other containers, zero runtime
overhead for the default case.

**Cons**: If `uses_allocator_v<T, Alloc>` is false and `Alloc` is a nonempty
class, then space is wasted storing an unused allocator.

**Suboptions for reducing wasted footprint storage** for non-AA elements:

a) We could create a special case that a default-constructed `Alloc` could be
   returned from `get_allocator()`, if `Alloc` is default-constructible.

b) In this case, inplace_vector could be non-allocator-aware, `allocator_type`
   and `get_allocator()` would not be defined, and no constructors would accept
   an allocator argument.

c) Supplying an allocator other than `std::allocator` for a type that cannot
   use it could be ill-formed; unfortunately, this design would make generic
   programming somewhat more difficult.

Option 2: `inplace_vector<class T, size_t N>`
---------------------------------------------

If `T::allocator_type` exists, then `inplace_vector<class T, size_t
N>::allocator_type` would also exist, as would `get_allocator()` and
allocator-accepting constructors.  Otherwise, the instantiation would not be
allocator aware.

**Pros**: Cannot accidentally forget to specify an allocator parameter when
using allocator-aware element types. <!-- lah: these pro and con items are a mix of sentences
and fragments and would be better if they were all complete sentences. --> 

**Cons**: If `T` is allocator-aware but the user doesn't want to take advantage
of that, an allocator is stored unnecessarily.  Worse, there are no obvious
work-arounds to avoid storing and using an allocator. Also, this approach is
inconsistent with other containers.

Option 3: `inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc =` *see below* `>`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *see below* type is `T::allocator_type` if such a type exists, and
`std::allocator<byte>` otherwise.

**Pros**: Accidentally forgetting to specify an allocator
parameter when using allocator-aware types (like Option 2) is easily avoided, but automatic
allocator selection can be easily overridden.

**Cons**: Inconsistent with other containers, which do not automatically detect
the element's allocator type. When an allocator is not supplied by the user, it
is possible to incur an penalty for an accidentally allocator-aware container.

Option 4: `basic_inplace_vector<class T, size_t N, class Alloc>`
----------------------------------------------------------------

This approach has a separate template, `basic_inplace_vector`, for
allocator-aware inplace vector.

**Pros**: Reduces complications with `inplace_vector` specification and
implementation.  Potentially reduces compile time compared to some of the
preceding options.

**Cons**: The two types of inplace vector are not compatible.  The user needs
to make a decision, especially in generic code, whether they ever expect to
have allocator-aware elements. It is easy to choose the shorter name at the
expense of breaking scoped allocation in generic code. Increases *overall*
specification complexity and implementation because now there are *two* classes
to specify, implement, and test, where `basic_inplace_vector` is just as
complicated as options 1 or 3, above.

Performance and Compile-time Costs
==================================

About the Performance Tests
---------------------------

When people talk about "low- or no-cost abstractions," they usually mean
runtime costs, but we are increasingly seeing concern about compile-time costs
as metaprogramming, and concepts allow us to express ever-more complex
constructs. To aid the committee in evaluating the options, therefore, it is
important to collect data on both the runtime and compile-time costs of adding
generic allocator awareness to `inplace_vector`.

I performed a set of experiments with a subset of an `inplace_vector`
implementation, looking at the generated assembly code and measuring compile
times for a non-allocator-aware version, as proposed in [@P0843R10], compared
to options 1, 2, and 3 described above. Option 4 was not measured, as it
involves a completely separate class template, `basic_inplace_vector`, that
would presumably not affect the performance of the unmodified `inplace_vector`
except for the nominal cost of reading the text of the header file at
compilation time.

The [runtime](#run-time-results) and
[compile-time results](#compile-time-results) are shown below, after the
[Methodology](#methodology) section.

Methodology
-----------

Allocator-awareness was added to a partial implementation of [@P0843R10]. To
save effort, only functionality needed for the test program was
implemented. For the allocator-aware versions of `inplace_vector`, compile time
was reduced marginally by implementing a partial specialization for the common
case of `std::allocator`. The test driver was designed to maximize the number
of distinct instantiations of `inplace_vector`, its constructors, and its
insertion methods (especially `push_back`), thus producing a near-worst-case
scenario for any template-instantiation penalty caused by the inclusion of the
allocator machinery.

Compilation was launched from a Python script that compiled but did not link
five identical files, each of which `#include`d the test program. Compilation was
timed for each combination of implementation option, compiler, and element
types (allocator-ware, non-allocator-aware or blended/both).  The script also
generated one assembly listing and one executable for each configuration. The
generation of the assembly and executable files was not included in the timings
tests. The executable was run as a *smoke test* to ensure that the code ran and
passed some simple tests, but the run time was too short for any meaningful
comparisons and so was not measured; runtime performance equivalence was
deduced based on assembly-language equivalence. Timing jitter was on the order
of 3-4%, so timing differences under 5% should be ignored.

The tests were run on a Lenovo ThinkPad running Ubuntu 22.04 Linux within the
Windows Subsystem for Linux. The CPU was an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7-11850H running at 2.50GH with 64GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. The compilers used
in the test were GCC 11.4.0 using `-std=C++23` and Clang 14.0.0 using
`-std=C++2b`. All tests were conducted with level `-O2` optimization. The
experimental sources and scripts can be found at
[https://github.com/phalpern/WG21-halpern/tree/main/P3160-AA-inplace_vector/](P3160-AA-inplace_vector/)

Run Time Results
----------------

The test program was not designed to measure runtime. Although a smoke test was
performed on each option to test that it produced correct results, run times
were too short to produce meaningful comparisons.  Instead, I compared
assembly-language output from each configuration to see if the presence of the
allocator machinery produced any difference in the generated output for both
allocator-aware element types and non-allocator-aware element types. Comparing
GCC-to-GCC and Clang-to-Clang produced the same results, shown in the table
below.

*Comparing assembly-language against P0843R10*

|          | Non-allocator-aware `T` | Allocator-aware `T` |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Option 1 | **Identical**           | **Identical**       |
| Option 2 | **Identical**           | *Different*       |
| Option 3 | **Identical**           | *Different*       |

From this table, we can infer that there is no runtime penalty for the
allocator machinery when the element type does not use an allocator.  Moreover,
option 1 produced no penalty when the element types *do* use an allocator,
provided that the allocator was not specifically provided to `inplace_vector`,
i.e., when `inplace_vector` was instantiated with the default allocator
(`std::allocator<T>`).  Options 2 and 3 produced different results for
allocator-aware element types, as expected, since the default allocator type
for `inplace_vector<T, N>` is `T::allocator_type` in both cases, rather than
`std::allocator<T>`.

From these results, we can conclude that Option 1 produces no runtime penalty
for using the default allocator parameter; any penalty would be borne
exclusively by users that deliberately specify an allocator argument.

Compile Time Results
--------------------

The raw data shown in the tables below present the increase in user-mode
compile time for each option when compared to the [@P0843R10] status quo. They
show that there is no appreciable compile-time penalty using any of the options
when the element type is not allocator-aware (e.g., `inplace_vector<int, N>`).
Option 1 also had no penalty for allocator-aware element types when the
allocator type was left at the default `std::allocator<T>`.  Options 2 and 3
did exhibit a noticeable compile-time impact for allocator-aware elements
(e.g., `inplace_vector<pmr::string, N>`). The additional compile time can be
attributed to the machinery for passing the allocator to the elements when an
allocator is provided as well as the metaprogramming needed to determine if
`T::allocator_type` exists.

From these results, we can conclude that the allocator-aware `inplace_vector`
described in option 1 imposes no significant compile-time cost compared to a
non-allocator-aware `inplace_vector`.

Wording
=======

Wording will be provided after intial LEWG discussion.

**Design Decisions**

- Are we are interested in an allocator-aware `inplace_vector`?

- Which interface (options 1 -- 4) do we want?

- How should the allocator be passed to the inserted elements, via
  *uses-allocator construction* or via `allocator_traits::construct`?

**Procedural Decisions**

How should I specify wording? I can think of three possible ways (listed from
least to most effort).

1. Work with the authors of P0843 to integrate allocator wording.

2. Create a separate diff against P0843 wording.

3. Wait until P0843 has been merged with the WP and create a diff against the
   WP.
